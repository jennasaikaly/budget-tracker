  ## Installation

  To install the app, the user can visit the website and click the 'install' icon, which is located in/on the URL address bar, depending on whether the user is accessing the site on a computer or on a mobile phone.

  ## Usage 

  The project is used by peoples who are travelling and would like to keep track of their expenses.  The user will input the transaction name, the amount, and then choose whether to add or subtract the expense from the tracker.  The user will be presented with a table of their expenses, current balance, and a graph so that the user can see a visual representation of their tracker balance.  This is a PWA and can be used offline. Once the user has an internet connection again, the offline entries which have been stored in a cache will then be added to the database.
